          Current data collection often relies on self-report surveys, capturing limited information and leaving much of the narrative untold. Face-to-face interviews yield more accurate and comprehensive assessments compared to standard tools, but time constraints prevent this gold-standard approach from scaling to every participant. This talk introduces the 3rd Ear voice interviewing platform for building conversational agents that dynamically adapt their questioning to each respondent's answers. By focusing on interviewing rather than offering judgment or recommendations, we minimize the risks of AI hallucinations and bias. The platform orchestrates adaptive, goal-directed dialogue that aligns with established methodologies while unveiling a more nuanced understanding of the respondent's story. Our AI interviewers not only gather standardized data that researchers and professionals rely on but also uncover richer narratives that can inform better analysis and outcomes. The 3rd Ear platform bridges the gap between simple surveys and human-led interviews, enabling more nuanced, accessible, and beneficial assessments at scale. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>
